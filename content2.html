<p>	Captian America is better than Iron man because Iron Man has to wear a suit that helps him from getting beat up and stops him getting killed faster. Captain America on the other hand he doen't have a suit and he doesn't need to have one because since is so strong it will take time for him to actually die unless the person he is fighing use's a weapon to kill him. Captian America is a Real American Hero because he doesn't chose to fight his own team and attemps to kill them.
